This is my personal configuration for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim). I prefer to use [Lua](https://www.lua.org/), than [Vimscript](http://vimscript.org/) for boost the speed (which I haven't test it until now, I will test it later).

I put a little code in my init.lua, then I imported lua files at lua folder as we taught in `:h lua.txt`. There are my plugins that I use [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as package manager (it isn't).

My remap or binding keys is there too, but binding for plugins is located at `after/plugin/`. There also plugins configuration and options.

Hope it gives you benefits as I just newbie in publication document. Thanks.
